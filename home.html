	Brent Rudolph Hrncir grew up the son of a farmer. He was use to long days in the heat and working hard. He went on to pursue a successful career in the Airoforce. After he retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel, he went on to a career for United Airlines. Through out his time in the Air Force and Air Lines he never went out of touch with his upbrining.
He always was learning. From building his own chicken coops to fixing a old broken down Ford truck, Brent never stop learning.

The grubbing plow changed farming in the Coastal Bend by “grubbing” up the roots of mesquite trees, which tended to grow fast and become matted under the surface of the dirt. The machine, which was a combination of a root grubber and regular plow, contributed to Nueces County being the most mechanized county in Texas in 1920, said Tyner Little, Nueces County governmental affairs.

“The economic impact of this instrument is in the millions,” Little said. “Sixty-one to 70 percent of the county was prime farmland.
